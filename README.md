#Dynamic Resume Builder!

I built a web-based dynamic resume builder using TypeScript, HTML, and CSS, allowing users to easily create and preview customized resumes. This tool captures user input for personal information, education, experience, skills, and projects, generating a professional-looking resume instantly! 📄✨

Key Features:

Real-Time Preview 🖥️
Image Upload & Dynamic Display 📸
Easy Input for Personal, Educational, and Professional Details 🎓💼
Seamless and Responsive UI 🌐
This project enhanced my skills in TypeScript and JavaScript DOM manipulation, and I’m thrilled to see it come to life!
